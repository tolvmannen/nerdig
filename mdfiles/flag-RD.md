## RD: Recursion Desired

Query   | Response               
:-------|:---------------------
Request for recursion  | Mirrored from query
<br/>

This bit may be set in a query and is copied into the response. If RD is set,
it directs the name server to pursue the query recursively.
Recursive query support is optional and normally only available when querying
a resolver.
