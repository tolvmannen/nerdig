Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS) is a specification for expanding the size 
of several parameters of the DNS protocol.
EDNS introduces a single pseudo-RR type: OPT.
As pseudo-RRs, OPT type RRs never appear in any zone file; 
they exist only in messages, fabricated by the DNS participants.


For full info on EDNS options see the DNS parameter document maintained by
[IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-11)
