# NerDIG

No Experience Required DIG (NerDIG) is my take on an educational DIG client.

### Goal

NerDIG is meant to be:

- Educational - lowerig the bar for usong the standard DIG client available on 
  most OS platforms. It mimics a terminal, while also allowing you to click on 
  various parts of the output to get more information.
  In addition there is a click-to-copy test line that lets you try the command
  out in you regular dig client.

- Easy to use - as in installing and running locally, or on a public host, with
  minimal configuration and easy to follow instructions.

- Easy to develop - with easy to follow and well documented code, limited
  dependencies and a very lightweigt frontend. 
  Thr backend is written i go and frontend uses only HTML/CSS and a little 
  HTMX. 

- Easy to contribute to - either with code, knowlege or feature requests.

The idea, design and parts of the backend code has been shamelessly stolen
